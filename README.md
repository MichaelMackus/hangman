# Hangman-Game-Haskell
Implementation of the game Hangman in Haskell.

Consider the following version of hangman:

- One player secretly types in a word.

- The other player tries to deduce the word, by entering a sequence of guesses.

- For each guess, the computer indicates which letters in the secret word occur in the guess.

- The game ends when the guess is correct. We adopt a top down approach to implementing

The materials were gathered from the book "Programming in Haskell" http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html
